## Overview

This guide explains how to install the PlatON Node software on Linux Distributions.



## Installation Overview

Installing a new node is generally a 3 to 4-step process and will depend on the operating system. Each install option is listed in this guide and is accessible from the table of contents or select from the list below:

- Installing with Ubuntu (18.04)




## Installing with Ubuntu (18.04)

### Open a terminal and run the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update &&
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl software-properties-common ntp &&
sudo systemctl enable ntp && sudo systemctl start ntp
```

### Validate the NTP time synchronization

```bash
ntpq -p
```

**Display the following information:**

```bash
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter

```

### Install PlatON

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ppatwo/platon &&
sudo apt-get update &&
sudo apt-get install platon0.11.0 &&
platon version
```

After executing the above command,  `platon` and` keytool` binary have been successfully installed in the `/usr/bin` directory on your system, you can execute related commands in any directory.



## Generate wallet

You can use the node client file to generate a wallet file. Here is an example of generating a wallet in the keystore folder under the `data` directory. You can execute the following command in the node working directory (eg: ` ~/platon-node`):

### Ubuntu

```bash
mkdir -p data && platon --datadir ./data account new
```

> Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
>
> Passphrase:
>
> Repeat passphrase:
>
> Address: {550ae58b051a8e942f858ef22019c1c622292f7e}
>
> **Attention：**
>
> The wallet file and password are very important for the generated account address. Losing the wallet file or forgetting the password will cause the token in the account to be lost. Please make a backup of the wallet file and remember the password.
>
> If the password is set to blank or the number of digits is less than 6 (excluding the leading and trailing spaces), it will not support importing into ATON wallet.
>

## Generate private key

### Public and private keys

Each node in the network has a unique identity to distinguish it from each other. This identity is a public and private key pair, which can be generated in the node's working directory (eg:  `~/platon-node`) by the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/platon-node/data && keytool genkeypair | tee >(grep "PrivateKey" | awk '{print $2}' > ./data/nodekey) >(grep "PublicKey" | awk '{print $3}' > ./data/nodeid)
```

> Address:  0x6877944bC950799C0511beECB7824A818C35920D 
>
> PrivateKey:  002925955b165bd33be1d97082df17cd269f10e6f5142f77e2605ed591d314b
>
> PublicKey :  064a22d0bbf537125f1beeab0efcf77b0a62680d44f5b66a2d12574b159601e662edbb6b57aea5eafabbff8ba5157ef613fe4b176cb8d97ea4951b6815748973

 `PrivateKey` is the private key of the node, and` PublicKey` is the public key of the node. The public key is used to identify the identity of the node and can be made public.

Two files will be generated in the subdirectory `data` under the working directory of the node：

- nodeid: node public key (ID) file, holds the node's public key
- nodekey: node private key file, which holds the node's private key



### BLS public and private key

In addition to the public and private nodes of the node, the PlatON node also needs a key pair called the BLS public and private key. This key pair will be used in the consensus protocol. The key pair can be in the node's working directory (such as `~/platon-node`) generated by the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/platon-node/data && keytool genblskeypair | tee >(grep "PrivateKey" | awk '{print $2}' > ./data/blskey) >(grep "PublicKey" | awk '{print $3}' > ./data/blspub)
```

> PrivateKey:  f22a785c80bd1095beff1f356811268eae6c94abf0b2b4e2d64918957b74783e
> PublicKey :  4bf873a66df92ada50a8c6bacb132ffd63437bcde7fd338d2d8696170034a6332e404ac3abb50326ee517ec5f63caf12891ce794ed14f8528fa7c54bc0ded7c5291f708116bb8ee8adadf1e88588866325d764230f4a45929d267a9e8f264402

 `PrivateKey` is the BLS private key of the node, and` PublicKey` is the BLS public key of the node. The BLS public key is used to quickly verify the signature in the consensus protocol and can be published. The BLS private key cannot be made public and needs to be backed up.

Two files will be generated in the subdirectory `data` under the working directory of the node:

- blspub: Node BLS public key file, which holds the node's BLS public key

- blskey: Node BLS private key file, which holds the node's BLS private key

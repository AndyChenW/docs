1. Usages of DevNetwork Faucet and Test Coin

We set a faucet on DevNetwork to satisfy the requirements from developer. From faucet you can get the test coins for free. Then use the test coins to test the developing software(s) without loss of real tokens.

Note:

The test coins are worthless in real world. They can be used only  when you really need to test your software(s) on DevNetwork.
